#   intro: 
#     - "Bruno Loureiro is a researcher at the Centre for Data Science at the École Normale Supérieure in Paris working on the crossroads between machine learning and statistical mechanics."
#     - "Before moving to ENS, he was a postdoc at the Institut de Physique Théorique (IPhT) in Paris and at the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Lausanne, where he worked with Lenka Zdeborová and Florent Krzakala."
#     - "Before his postdoc, he read the part III of the Mathematics Tripos at the University of Cambridge, and continued into a PhD at the TCM group in the same university. During his PhD he worked on the Holographic Principle, a duality stemming from string theory that relates quantum field theories to classical theories of gravity. Bruno Loureiro 's thesis was centred on applications of this duality to strongly coupled condensed matter systems, with a particular focus on disordered systems."
